/*Descending Order Names
Write a program that prompts the user to enter three names. Your program should display the names in descending order. */

/*
NOTE TO THE TEACHER: the task too confusing. It does not specify the criterion based on which we should order the names.
Should the names be ordered based on their length? In alphabetical order? Based on the number of vowels?
I had to use the Show The Answer option to understand what is required and what exactly is expected from me :)
